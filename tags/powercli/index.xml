      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a vSphere admin, you&amp;rsquo;ll be very familiar with the esxcli command. But have you ever wondered how to run esxcli commands from PowerCLI? Maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t want to enable SSH on your hosts, or perhaps you need to run an esxcli command in a PowerShell script.</description>

      <title>Add Hard Disks to VMs Asynchronously with PowerCLI</title>

      <description>At the time of writing the &lt;code&gt;New-HardDisk&lt;/code&gt; PowerCLI CmdLet does not yet have a &lt;code&gt;-RunAsync&lt;/code&gt; parameter. I found this out when trying to create a new 300 GiB eagerly zeroed disk on multiple VMs in one go. I soon realised that I was going to be sat there for a long time as each new disk was being formatted one at a time.</description>

      <description>I recently had to provide our networking team with a list of ESXi hosts and which switchports each of their physical NICs were connected to. Like many other environments, we are primarily a Cisco house and therefore I was able to get this data by querying the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) information via PowerCLI. Here is how I went about it.</description>

      <title>Storage DRS and PowerCLI Part 1: Get VM Overrides</title>
      <link>https://ryanjan.uk/storage-drs-and-powercli-part-1-get-vm-overrides/</link>

      <guid>https://ryanjan.uk/storage-drs-and-powercli-part-1-get-vm-overrides/</guid>
      <description>Introduction With Storage DRS (SDRS) enabled datastore clusters, we have many options to configure overrides on a per-VM basis. For example disabling SDRS for a specific VM or forcing SDRS to keep a VMs VMDK files on separate datastores (anti-affinity). However, one thing which has caught out our 2nd line team recently and caused us some SDRS performance issues is that when you manually Storage vMotion (svMotion) one or more VMDK files and pick a specific datastore as the destination, you have to tick a box that disables SDRS for the particular VM.</description>

      <description>Introduction A colleague of mine recently asked for some help with a script he was writing. We use vSphere tags in order to determine which backup schedule a given VM is in and he wanted to find all VMs which were not assigned a tag in the category backup-service-level, and therefore were not being backed up. His actual query was regarding filtering out certain VMs which will never be given a backup tag.</description>
