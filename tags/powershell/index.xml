      <description>At the time of writing the &lt;code&gt;New-HardDisk&lt;/code&gt; PowerCLI CmdLet does not yet have a &lt;code&gt;-RunAsync&lt;/code&gt; parameter. I found this out when trying to create a new 300 GiB eagerly zeroed disk on multiple VMs in one go. I soon realised that I was going to be sat there for a long time as each new disk was being formatted one at a time.</description>

      <title>Managing vSphere Global Permissions with PowerShell</title>
      <link>https://ryanjan.uk/vsphere-global-permissions-with-powershell/</link>

      <description>It appears that working with vSphere global permissions in PowerCLI is not yet possible. The VIPerms PowerShell module combines the add/remove examples from William&amp;rsquo;s post with a new function to list all global permissions. In this post I will demonstrate how to install and use this module.</description>

      <description>I recently had to provide our networking team with a list of ESXi hosts and which switchports each of their physical NICs were connected to. Like many other environments, we are primarily a Cisco house and therefore I was able to get this data by querying the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) information via PowerCLI.

      <description>Introduction A colleague of mine recently asked for some help with a script he was writing. We use vSphere tags in order to determine which backup schedule a given VM is in and he wanted to find all VMs which were not assigned a tag in the category backup-service-level, and therefore were not being backed up.
