      <description>I have just successfully migrated one of our vCenter 6.0 Windows servers to a brand new 6.7 U1 vCenter Server Appliance. After this migration I configured VMCA to be a intermediate certificate authority to our internal CA. The process for this is relatively straight forward, however, there appears to be an issue in 6.7 (and potentially 6.5) whereby hosts which are subsequently issued a new SSL certificate fail to use the full certificate chain, and therefore still show as untrusted in the browser when accessing the ESXi host client.</description>
