      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a vSphere admin, you&amp;rsquo;ll be very familiar with the esxcli command. But have you ever wondered how to run esxcli commands from PowerCLI? Maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t want to enable SSH on your hosts, or perhaps you need to run an esxcli command in a PowerShell script.</description>

      <title>Add Hard Disks to VMs Asynchronously with PowerCLI</title>

      <description>At the time of writing the &lt;code&gt;New-HardDisk&lt;/code&gt; PowerCLI CmdLet does not yet have a &lt;code&gt;-RunAsync&lt;/code&gt; parameter. I found this out when trying to create a new 300 GiB eagerly zeroed disk on multiple VMs in one go. I soon realised that I was going to be sat there for a long time as each new disk was being formatted one at a time.</description>

      <title>Managing vSphere Global Permissions with PowerShell</title>

      <description>It appears that working with vSphere global permissions in PowerCLI is not yet possible. The VIPerms PowerShell module combines the add/remove examples from William&amp;rsquo;s post with a new function to list all global permissions. In this post I will demonstrate how to install and use this module.</description>

      <title>ESXi Host Certificate Renewal Doesn&#39;t Include Full Chain</title>
      <link>https://ryanjan.uk/esxi-host-certificate-renewal-doesnt-include-full-chain/</link>

      <guid>https://ryanjan.uk/esxi-host-certificate-renewal-doesnt-include-full-chain/</guid>
      <description>I have just successfully migrated one of our vCenter 6.0 Windows servers to a brand new 6.7 U1 vCenter Server Appliance. After this migration I configured VMCA to be a intermediate certificate authority to our internal CA. The process for this is relatively straight forward, however, there appears to be an issue in 6.7 (and potentially 6.5) whereby hosts which are subsequently issued a new SSL certificate fail to use the full certificate chain, and therefore still show as untrusted in the browser when accessing the ESXi host client.</description>

      <description>I recently had to provide our networking team with a list of ESXi hosts and which switchports each of their physical NICs were connected to. Like many other environments, we are primarily a Cisco house and therefore I was able to get this data by querying the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) information via PowerCLI. Here is how I went about it.</description>

      <title>vRealize Operations Manager Upgrade Fails Due To Swap Issue</title>

      <guid>https://ryanjan.uk/vrops-upgrade-fail-due-to-swap-issues/</guid>
      <description>Today I upgraded my non-production vRealize Operations Manager (vROps) appliance from v6.7 to v7.0. However, when applying the initial OS update .pak file via the admin interface, the upgrade immediately failed with the error message &amp;quot;source ./pak_python_wrapper.sh validate.py&amp;quot; failed.
Initially a colleague of mine pointed me to the well known disk space issues (KB article), but a quick look at the disk stats showed that there was plenty of space available on all partitions.</description>

      <title>Storage DRS and PowerCLI Part 1: Get VM Overrides</title>

      <guid>https://ryanjan.uk/storage-drs-and-powercli-part-1-get-vm-overrides/</guid>
      <description>Introduction With Storage DRS (SDRS) enabled datastore clusters, we have many options to configure overrides on a per-VM basis. For example disabling SDRS for a specific VM or forcing SDRS to keep a VMs VMDK files on separate datastores (anti-affinity). However, one thing which has caught out our 2nd line team recently and caused us some SDRS performance issues is that when you manually Storage vMotion (svMotion) one or more VMDK files and pick a specific datastore as the destination, you have to tick a box that disables SDRS for the particular VM.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post explains my recent experiences with certain hosts losing access to some of our VMFS datastores. Hopefully it will help someone avoid the pain that I have been through in diagnosing this issues!
The Symptoms I was initially made aware of this issue as it appeared that certain hosts were losing connectivity to VMFS datastores. Upon investigation I found the following events being logged very frequently against multiple hosts.</description>

      <description>Introduction A colleague of mine recently asked for some help with a script he was writing. We use vSphere tags in order to determine which backup schedule a given VM is in and he wanted to find all VMs which were not assigned a tag in the category backup-service-level, and therefore were not being backed up. His actual query was regarding filtering out certain VMs which will never be given a backup tag.</description>

      <description>I recently stumbled across the Gogs project whilst looking for self-hosted Git solutions. I run a FreeNAS server at home so I thought I would get the app up and running in a jail. Here is how I did it.
Jail Preparation Create a new jail named gogs and make sure that the jail is up to date by running.

      <description>Welcome! I&amp;rsquo;m Ryan, and this is a blog.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Senior DevOps Engineer based in the UK and I work at one of the top Universities in the world. My role focusses heavily on Terraform and Google Cloud, and as such many of my posts will be in these areas, although I will throw in some different content from time to time.
I regularly find myself working through interesting issues in my day job and this is a place for me to share any experiences that I think might be of interest to others.</description>
